#Searching Algorithms: 
Searching algorithms are essential tools in computer science used to
locate specific items within a collection of data. In this tutorial, we are mainly going to focus
upon searching in an array. When we search an item in an array, there are two most common
algorithms used based on the type of input array. 

1. Linear search: Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a fundamental algorithm
used to find a specific element within a data structure, typically a list or an array. It operates
by sequentially examining each element in the data structure, starting from the beginning, until
the target element is found or the end of the data structure is reached.

Binary Search: It is used for a sorted array. It mainly compares the array's middle element
first and if the middle element is same as input, then it returns. Otherwise it searches in either
left half or right half based on comparison result (Whether the mid element is smaller or greater)
